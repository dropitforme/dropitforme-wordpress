## Contents

Working on it!

## Installation

The DropItForMe Plugin can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is".

## Recommended Tools

### i18n Tools

The WordPress Plugin DropItForMe Plugin uses a variable to store the text domain used when internationalizing strings throughout the DropItForMe Plugin. To take advantage of this method, there are tools that are recommended for providing correct, translatable files:

* [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)
* [makepot](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/)
* [i18n](https://github.com/grappler/i18n)

Any of the above tools should provide you with the proper tooling to internationalize the plugin.

## Important Notes

### Licensing

The WordPress Plugin DropItForMe Plugin is licensed under the GPL v2 or later; however, if you opt to use third-party code that is not compatible with v2, then you may need to switch to using code that is GPL v3 compatible.

For reference, [here's a discussion](http://make.wordpress.org/themes/2013/03/04/licensing-note-apache-and-gpl/) that covers the Apache 2.0 License used by [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/).

### Includes

Note that if you include your own classes, or third-party libraries, there are three locations in which said files may go:

* `plugin-name/includes` is where functionality shared between the admin area and the public-facing parts of the site reside
* `plugin-name/admin` is for all admin-specific functionality
* `plugin-name/public` is for all public-facing functionality

Note that previous versions of the DropItForMe Plugin did not include `Plugin_Name_Loader` but this class is used to register all filters and actions with WordPress.

The example code provided shows how to register your hooks with the Loader class.

### What About Other Features?

The previous version of the WordPress Plugin DropItForMe Plugin included support for a number of different projects such as the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater).

These tools are not part of the core of this DropItForMe Plugin, as I see them as being additions, forks, or other contributions to the DropItForMe Plugin.

The same is true of using tools like Grunt, Composer, etc. These are all fantastic tools, but not everyone uses them. In order to  keep the core DropItForMe Plugin as light as possible, these features have been removed and will be introduced in other editions, and will be listed and maintained on the project homepage
